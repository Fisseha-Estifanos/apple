A fun shuffler to feed applers apple.

I guess this might not be a big deal for you guys, however it means the world to me.
I recently bought a macbook pro due to the help of two great friends named Natanan Shiferaw and Milky, and suddenly this idea came to mind.

Rules
1. Everyday this code will shuffle a name and post it to our telegram channel.
2. The person who's name is posted will have to eat an Apple that day and post it to this channel.
3. The apples to be eaten by the lucky ones will be populated every week by the five people that ate the apples on each day of the week.
